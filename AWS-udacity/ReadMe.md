I got an introduction to machine learning (ML) with AWS and AWS AI devices: AWS DeepLens, AWS DeepComposer, and AWS DeepRacer. Learn the basics of computer vision with AWS DeepLens, race around a track and get familiar with reinforcement learning with AWS DeepRacer, and discover the power of generative AI by creating music using AWS DeepComposer.
